## Natural Language Search with NLP - NLS
Lead: @vrushaliashok

### Why
Search bars don't work well on any site, least of all when it's something as nuanced and emotional as volunteering.

### How
Make searching more intuitive and intelligent, releasing the effort/load from the volunteer and instead learning and understanding what the volunteer is really looking for based on previous experiences and NLP.

### What
Goodsted introduces a user-friendly search feature that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) to match concepts instead of just keywords. This approach makes searching for opportunities more intuitive and precise. Whether it's finding relevant opportunities based on specific preferences or exploring broader themes, the NLP-powered search ensures that users discover opportunities that align with their interests. This feature benefits users across different platforms, from documentation sites to marketplaces, providing a more efficient and concept-focused search experience.
